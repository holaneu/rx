Shared Blueprint Utilities

This package contains shared utilities and helper functions
used across multiple blueprints to avoid code duplication:
- helpers: Common template helpers and utility functions
- decorators: Blueprint decorators for authentication, validation, etc.

These utilities promote code reuse and consistency across
all blueprint modules.
