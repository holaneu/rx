# General Coding Instructions

- Use very descriptive variable names to improve readability and maintainability of the code.

- Use extensive comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each code block. Ensure comments provide meaningful context and help future readers understand the logic.

- Write clean and effective code, following principles of simplicity, readability, and maintainability.

- Do not remove empty rows that already exist.        

- Do not remove already existing comments unless their content is no longer semantically relevant.

- Use English language consistently for all variable names, function names, and comments.
